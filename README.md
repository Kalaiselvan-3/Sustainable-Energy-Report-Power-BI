# 🌱 Sustainable Energy Report | Power BI

Project Description:
Developed an interactive Sustainable Energy Analytics Report using Microsoft Power BI to analyze global energy production, consumption, and sustainability trends. The report provides insights into renewable vs non-renewable energy usage, carbon emissions, energy efficiency, and country-wise energy performance, helping stakeholders understand progress toward sustainable energy goals.

The dashboard transforms complex energy datasets into clear, actionable visualizations that support environmental analysis, policy planning, and strategic decision-making related to clean and sustainable energy initiatives.
